# My Golf page
I am a golfer on the Univerity of Missouri's Golf team

I started golfing when I was three years old with my dad.

My *favorite* memory golfing is breaking 70 for the frist time with my grandpa.

My *favorite* golf course is [Old Corkscrew](http://www.oldcorkscrew.com/) in Estero, FL
